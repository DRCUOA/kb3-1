        <p>This is a Node.js app that helps you learn to code. It features a 'topic' approach, where each topic has a
          number of related sub-topics and each sub-topic has any number of 'cards' that represent, together for each
          overall topic, the body of knowledge that it required to be known to be competent in that topic.</p>
        <p>It is study aid, where you create the content yourself from your learning and other projects you do to aquire
          knowledge. The app gives a structure to make 'cards' which is the lowest level of detail you can add.</p>
        <p>It's core features are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The app intended for multiple users.</li>
          <li>A user must have a unique username, they can choose it (any string &lt; 15 chars is acceptable&gt;)</li>
          <li>View all topics on a single page and use word search or filter to highlight matching topics.</li>
          <li>Create new topics</li>
          <li>Drill down from topic, the body of knowledge you need, e.g. 'design-patterns', to sub-topic, e.g.
            'Singleton Pattern' to finally view 'cards' which are the sub-sub-sub topics, in this example, all things
            you need to know to use the Singleton Pattern.</li>
          <li>A template for cards is provided as a boostrap model which contents a html form. Form feature requirements
            are:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>a radio button for the user to indicate if the card they want to create relates to an existing topic or
              a new topic.</li>
            <li>a radio button for the user to inidcate if the card they want to create relates to an existing sub-topic
              or a new sub-topic.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>The form will use the inputs in 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 as logic to format/structure the remainder of the inputs
            required asfollows:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>If 4.0.1 indicates a new topic, the form will revert to 'open' inputs that are not based on the existing
              data from the database and if it indicates an existing topic, user must be presented with a list of all
              existing topics in the database to choose one from.</li>
            <li>The user must be able to select a topic and sub-topic, free or from existing entries under the topic in
              the database based on the prior selections and input form 4.0.1 and 4.0.2.</li>
            <li>When the user has selected, topic AND sub-topic from 4.2, they must be able to enter the details of the
              card they want to create and provide a source for the card information and hyperlink to external reference
              if appropriate for more information.</li>
          </ol>
        </ol>
