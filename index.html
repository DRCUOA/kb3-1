        </h2>
        <p>
            The Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern is a popular way to
            structure web applications. It separates the application into three main
            components: the model, which represents the data and the logic for
            manipulating that data; the view, which represents the user interface and
            is responsible for rendering the data from the model; and the controller,
            which is the intermediary between the model and the view and handles the
            routing of requests.
        </p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
        <p>
            Using the MVC design pattern can help you to create a well-organized,
            maintainable, and scalable web application. In this briefing document, we
            will go over the key considerations to keep in mind when designing a web
            application using the MVC pattern.

        <p>
            <a name="_Toc122433404">Identify the data sources:</a>
            The first step in designing the model is to identify the sources of data
            that the application will use. This may include external APIs, databases,
            or other data sources. You will need to consider how to retrieve, process,
            and store this data in a way that is efficient and scalable.
        </p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
        <p>
            <a name="_Toc122433405">Define the business logic:</a>
            The model should also contain the business logic for your application. This
            includes the rules and processes for manipulating and managing the data,
            such as validation, authentication, and authorization.

                Identify the goals and objectives of the application
            </a><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            : Before you begin designing your application, it is important to clearly
            define the goals and objectives of the project. This will help to ensure
            that you are focusing on the most important aspects of the application and
            that you are able to deliver a product that meets the needs of your users.
        </p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
        <p>
            <a name="_Toc122433407">Gather requirements from stakeholders:</a>
            In order to define the requirements for your application, you will need to
            gather input from a variety of stakeholders, including end users, business
            owners, and project sponsors. This may involve conducting interviews,
            surveys, or focus groups to gather information about the desired features
            and functionality of the application.
        </p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
        <p>
            <a name="_Toc122433408">Document the requirements:</a>
            Once you have gathered the requirements from stakeholders, it is important
            to document them in a clear and concise manner. This will help to ensure
            that everyone on the project team has a clear understanding of the desired
            features and functionality of the application.

        </h3>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Identify the user flows: To capture the desired sequence logic of your
            application, you will need to identify the different user flows that are
            possible within the application. This may include different paths that a
            user can take based on their actions or different scenarios that may arise.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Create a flowchart: A flowchart is a graphical representation of the steps
            that a user can take within an application. It can be a useful tool for
            visualizing the control flow of the application and identifying potential
            bottlenecks or issues.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Use pseudocode: Pseudocode is a way of writing out the logic of your
            application in a structured and easy-to-read manner. It can be a helpful
            tool for defining the control flow of your application and communicating it
            to the rest of the team.

            <a name="_Toc122433410">Managing routing:</a>
        </h3>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Use a router: To manage the routing of HTTP requests in your application,
            it is a good idea to use a router. A router is a module that handles the
            mapping of URLs to specific actions or functions within your application.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Define clear, logical routes: When defining your routes, it is important to
            make them clear and logical. This will make it easier for other developers
            to understand the flow of your application and for users to navigate the
            application.
        </p>
        <p><a href="#toc">Back</a>
            Use route groups: If you have a large number of routes in your application,
            it can be helpful to group them together using route groups. This can make
            your code more organized and easier to maintain.

      <div class="mdc-layout-grid__cell mdc-layout-grid__cell--span-12">
        <p>This is a Node.js app that helps you learn to code. It features a 'topic' approach, where each topic has a
          number of related sub-topics and each sub-topic has any number of 'cards' that represent, together for each
          overall topic, the body of knowledge that it required to be known to be competent in that topic.</p>
        <p>It is study aid, where you create the content yourself from your learning and other projects you do to aquire
          knowledge. The app gives a structure to make 'cards' which is the lowest level of detail you can add.</p>
        <p>It's core features are:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>The app intended for multiple users.</li>
          <li>A user must have a unique username, they can choose it (any string &lt; 15 chars is acceptable&gt;)</li>
          <li>View all topics on a single page and use word search or filter to highlight matching topics.</li>
          <li>Create new topics</li>
          <li>Drill down from topic, the body of knowledge you need, e.g. 'design-patterns', to sub-topic, e.g.
            'Singleton Pattern' to finally view 'cards' which are the sub-sub-sub topics, in this example, all things
            you need to know to use the Singleton Pattern.</li>
          <li>A template for cards is provided as a boostrap model which contents a html form. Form feature requirements
            are:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>a radio button for the user to indicate if the card they want to create relates to an existing topic or
              a new topic.</li>
            <li>a radio button for the user to inidcate if the card they want to create relates to an existing sub-topic
              or a new sub-topic.</li>
          </ol>
          <li>The form will use the inputs in 4.0.1 and 4.0.2 as logic to format/structure the remainder of the inputs
            required asfollows:</li>
          <ol>
            <li>If 4.0.1 indicates a new topic, the form will revert to 'open' inputs that are not based on the existing
              data from the database and if it indicates an existing topic, user must be presented with a list of all
              existing topics in the database to choose one from.</li>
            <li>The user must be able to select a topic and sub-topic, free or from existing entries under the topic in
              the database based on the prior selections and input form 4.0.1 and 4.0.2.</li>
            <li>When the user has selected, topic AND sub-topic from 4.2, they must be able to enter the details of the
              card they want to create and provide a source for the card information and hyperlink to external reference
              if appropriate for more information.</li>
